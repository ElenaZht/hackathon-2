Hi Elena,
Your idea is great, and the final result is impressive. 
You've successfully structured your project and incorporated almost all the topics and features we've covered in class.
Here are a couple of suggestions for future improvements:
-Data Management: Currently, it seems you're manually storing data, such as the animals for sale. 
 Integrating an external API could automate this process, providing real-time data and enhancing user experience.
-User Authentication: Adding login and registration features would have added a good plus to your project.
Keep up the good work!
